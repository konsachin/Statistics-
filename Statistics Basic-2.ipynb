    "\n",
    "The mean, median, and mode are all measures of central tendency, but they capture different aspects of the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean is the average value of a dataset. It is calculated by summing up all the values in the dataset and dividing by the total number of values. The mean is sensitive to extreme values, also known as outliers, as it takes into account the magnitude of all values.\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less affected by extreme values compared to the mean, making it a robust measure of central tendency.\n",
    "Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. Unlike the mean and median, the mode can be applied to both numerical and categorical data. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), more than one mode (multimodal), or no mode if all values occur with the same frequency.\n",
    "These measures are used to understand the typical or central value of a dataset. The choice of which measure to use depends on the nature of the data and the specific characteristics of the dataset. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the dataset is symmetrical and normally distributed, the mean, median, and mode are likely to be similar.\n",
    "If the dataset is skewed or contains outliers, the median may provide a better representation of the central tendency than the mean.\n",
    "If the dataset consists of categorical data, the mode would be the appropriate measure to use."

    "Skewness in data refers to the lack of symmetry in the distribution of values. In a perfectly symmetrical distribution, the data is evenly distributed around the mean, with equal frequencies of values on both sides. However, in a skewed distribution, the data is not evenly distributed, and there is a tendency for the values to cluster more towards one end of the distribution than the other.\n",

    "There are three main types of skewness:\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive skewness (right skew): In a positively skewed distribution, the tail of the distribution extends towards the higher end of the data range. This means that there are more extreme values on the right side of the distribution, while the majority of the data is clustered towards the lower end.\n",
    "Negative skewness (left skew): In a negatively skewed distribution, the tail of the distribution extends towards the lower end of the data range. This means that there are more extreme values on the left side of the distribution, while the majority of the data is clustered towards the higher end.\n",
    "Zero skewness: A distribution is considered to have zero skewness when it is perfectly symmetrical, with equal frequencies of values on both sides of the mean. In such cases, the mean, median, and mode are all equal.\n",
    "Skewness is an important aspect to consider when analyzing data, as it can affect the interpretation of statistical analyses and the selection of appropriate statistical methods. For example, when data is skewed, the mean may not accurately represent the central tendency of the distribution, and alternative measures such as the median may be more appropriate. Additionally, skewed data can impact the performance of certain statistical models and techniques, so it's important to assess and address skewness as part of the data analysis process.\n",

    "Mean: In a normal distribution, the mean is located at the center of the distribution. It is equal to the median and the mode. This is one of the defining characteristics of a normal distribution — its symmetry around the mean.\n",
    "Median: As mentioned, in a normal distribution, the median is equal to the mean. This is because a normal distribution is symmetric around its mean. Therefore, the middle value (median) coincides with the mean.\n",
    "Mode: Similarly, in a normal distribution, the mode is also equal to the mean and the median. Since the distribution is symmetric, the highest point of the curve (mode) is at the same location as the mean and median.\n",

    "Covariance can take on any value, positive, negative, or zero.

    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "Outliers can greatly affect the mean: Since the mean is calculated by summing up all values and dividing by the total number of values, extreme values (outliers) can heavily influence the value of the mean, pulling it towards the outlier.\n",
    "Outliers have minimal effect on the median: Unlike the mean, the median is not affected by extreme values. It represents the middle value when the data is ordered, so even if there are outliers, they won't impact the median as long as they don't change the order of the dataset significantly.\n",
    "Outliers may or may not affect the mode, depending on their frequency and position in the dataset.\n",
    "Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "Outliers can significantly affect the range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. Outliers can greatly increase the range by pulling one end of the range further away from the other.\n",
    "Outliers can increase the variance and standard deviation: Variance and standard deviation are measures of the spread of data points around the mean. Outliers can increase the variability by introducing large deviations from the mean.\n",
    "Outliers may affect the interquartile range (IQR) and percentiles, depending on their position in the dataset relative to the quartiles.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider the following dataset representing the incomes of individuals in a small town: [20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 1000]. Here, 1000 is an outlier compared to the other incomes.\n",

    "Impact on measures of central tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean income would be greatly influenced by the outlier, pulling it towards a higher value.\n",
    "Median: The median would remain relatively unaffected because it represents the middle value, which is still close to the other incomes.\n",
    "Mode: The mode would remain the same since there's no change in the most frequently occurring value."
