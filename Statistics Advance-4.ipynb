    "A t-test is used when the population standard deviation is unknown and has to be estimated from the sample data.\n",
    "It is appropriate for small sample sizes (typically less than 30) and when the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "The t-test uses the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation and adjusts for the uncertainty introduced by this estimation.\n",
    "There are different types of t-tests, such as the one-sample t-test, two-sample t-test, and paired t-test, each suited for specific scenarios.\n",
    "Z-test:\n",
    "A z-test is used when the population standard deviation is known, or the sample size is large (typically greater than 30).\n",
    "It assumes that the population variance is known and does not need to be estimated from the sample.\n",
    "The z-test is more appropriate for large sample sizes where the central limit theorem ensures that the sampling distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal.\n",
    "It is commonly used in scenarios where large datasets are available or in situations where the population standard deviation is known, such as quality control in manufacturing or clinical trials with a large number of participants.\n",
    "Example scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "T-test: Suppose you want to compare the mean exam scores of two groups of students (Group A and Group B) who received different teaching methods. Since you have a relatively small sample size for each group (e.g., 25 students), and you don't know the population standard deviation, you would use a two-sample t-test to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean scores between the two groups.\n",
    "Z-test: Imagine you're conducting a study to assess the effectiveness of a new drug in lowering blood pressure. You have a large dataset consisting of blood pressure measurements from 1000 patients before and after taking the drug. Since you have a large sample size (1000), and you know the population standard deviation of blood pressure changes from previous studies, you can use a z-test to determine if there is a significant difference in blood pressure before and after taking the drug."

    "In summary, larger sample sizes tend to result in smaller margins of error, providing more precise estimates of population parameters. This is because larger samples provide more information about the population, leading to more accurate estimates of the sample statistic and reducing the variability associated with estimating the population parameter."
